[singlepic=68,96,right]<p class="pm_first"><span>O</span>ne of <a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>'s many contributions to mathematics and science during the 20th century was his <a href="#1_turing">1952 paper</a> on "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" in which he suggested that a simple model of coupled differential equations could account for pattern formation in natural processes such as those found on animal coats. Such models are known as Reaction-Diffusion models, and take the following general form
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{D}\nabla^2\mathbf{q}+\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{q})
\]

<!--more-->

The equation describes how the concentration of each chemical components in q evolves as a function of the other components. I have chosen to illustrate the Gray-Scott model; the physical derivation of the reactant term is described in detail in <a href="#2_grayscott">[2]</a>, the addition of the diffusion term and the resultant behaviour in <a href="#3_pearson">[3]</a>. The model has two chemical components, U and V and is described as follows.
\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}U&=D_u\nabla^2U-UV^2+F(1-U) \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}V&=D_v\nabla^2V+UV^2-(F+k)V 
\end{align*}
\]

The model is what is knows as an activator-inhibitor model, in which one chemical acts to inhibit the growth of the other.
<h3>Simulation</h3>
The simulation is implemented with <a href="http://www.silverlight.net" target="_new">Silverlight 2.0</a>. For full details of the implementation see the separate <a href="http://www.planetmarshall.co.uk/index.php/2009/04/implentation-of-the-reaction-diffusion-simulation/">post</a>. For guidance in parameter selection, see <a href="#3_pearson">[3]</a>, or just select a preset and modify it. Note that the Png image generation feature currently requires the <a target="_new" href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> browser.
