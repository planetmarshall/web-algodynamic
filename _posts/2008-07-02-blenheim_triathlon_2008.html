<p class="pm_first"><span>T</span>he previous incarnation of this site was described by former colleague <a href="http://www.morseweb.co.uk" target="_blank">Rob Morse</a> as being too “geeky”, as most of the content consisted of material for my Open University maths courses. So, to mitigate the inevitable geekification of PlanetMarshall, the first post of the new site will be detailing my efforts at the 2008 <a href="http://www.theblenheimtriathlon.com" target="_new">Blenheim Triathlon</a>. Just to prove that you do not need to be an obese agoraphobe with a penchant for burgers and comics featuring half naked girls riding dragons to be a computer programmer.</p>
<p>On the 8th of June 2008 I took part in my first Triathlon, consisting of a 750m open water swim, a 20km cycle and a 5k run - a distance that is amusingly known as a "Sprint".</p><!--more-->
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>Not being a driver myself, my mother and sister had generously agreed to drive and spend the day at Blenheim Palace, which is about 2-3 hours from Cambridge. The event had clearly been organised with military precision, so I had my timing chip, race numbers and bike racked in the transition area with plenty of time to spare. </p>
<h3>The swim</h3>

[singlepic=13,112,150,right] <p>This is, by some margin, my worst event. Thanks though to the Cambridge Triathlon Club I'd manage to get some open water swimming training in the weeks beforehand so I was at least prepared for the challenges that involves. Of course, you have to wear a wetsuit; this is compulsory and since the water was 15°C I wouldn't have wanted to be in the lake without one. Additionally, under the water you can't see a damn thing and so you need to practice "sighting", which essentially means looking where you're going once in a while to make sure you haven't gone off at a 90° angle and are swimming into some swans. This happens suprisingly often. One thing that initially worried me was the "washing machine" effect of having about 100 competitive swimmers in the water all starting at the same time, most of which are considerably stronger than me. I found this to be not so much of a problem, as there was plenty of room and no one really goes off at full pelt - I suspect that there were many other first timers there and that they were being equally conservative with their effort.</p>

Even with adequate preparation, the swim was tough. I was unable to complete the full distance in freestyle, which left me doing breast stroke for a short distance in the middle ( backstroke is disallowed for safety reasons, and butterfly would just be stupid ). Incidentally, it's quite difficult to do breaststroke because the wetsuit is so buoyant that it makes it difficult to push your chest under the water - I was also not helped by the fact that I had now started to digest the Sainsbury's pasta salad I had had in the car (note to self, eat earlier next time). I have a lot of work to do before the <a href="http://www.thelondontriathlon.com" target="_new">London Triathlon</a>, which is twice the distance, and I would like to do all of it freestyle.
<h3>T1</h3>
<p>I was glad to get the swim over with, but my initial relief after being helped out of the water by the attendants was mitigated somewhat by the 400m uphill run to the transition area. Of course, I had known about this beforehand but nothing quite prepares you for the actual experience. I kept my mind off it by attempting to dislodge my wetsuit. At this point I was pleasantly surprised to see my mother and sister cheering me on, since I had assumed they would have buggered off round the gardens and left me to it.</p>

<p>[singlepic=23,150,112,left]I had never done one of these transitions before, but it seemed a fairly straightforward affair of getting the wetsuit off and getting onto the bike. The wetsuit came off quite easily thanks to a tip I had read about putting baby oil on my ankles prior to the swim. Now, if you watch experienced competitors during this period what usually happens is that they have cycling shoes clipped to the pedals prior to starting, which they put on during the initial few seconds of the race while on the bike. My strategy was similar, in that it involved running out of T1 without having put my shoes on. Where it differed was that I did not actually have any cycling shoes, because I had decided to just cycle with conventional pedals in my running shoes, shoes that were at this point back next to my wetsuit ( note to self, get proper pedals and shoes).</p>
<h3>The cycle</h3>
<p>
Having gone back to get my shoes, I was now able to settle in and enjoy the cycle. [singlepic=18,112,150,right]Cycling is my strongest discipline, and the course at Blenheim has few if any major challenges. There are some undulating sections but nothing that would greatly tax an experienced rider. I would expect most good cyclists to belt round the 20km course in less than 30 minutes. I have no idea what my time was because at about this point I realised that in my hurry to remove the wetsuit the timing chip had come with it. If that weren't enough, I followed another rider into the transition area on the wrong lap and so had to turn round to resume the race. I contented myself with spending the remainder of the race trying to overtake people on bikes that easily cost at least 10 times what I spent on mine. Two laps later I turned into transition, correctly, picked up my missing timing chip and got settled into the run.</p>  

<h3>The run</h3>
<p>[singlepic=21,112,150,left] Since running half of the Cambridge Boundary Run in February in a fairly feeble 2:01, running was the discipline that I had probably spent most time training. Still, going straight into a 5k from quite a fast cycle is still a bit of a shock when you do it for the first time. The heat was really a factor at this point and I really began to look forward to the various places on the run at which the attendants were spraying runners with cold water. There are two laps to the run, the disadvantage of this is it's a bit demoralizing to approach the finish line on the first lap knowing you have to do it all over again. The advantage is that it gives you a chance to familiarize yourself with the course, so that when I approached the finish for the second time I was able to kick and start overtaking some of the other competitors. I stopped short of overtaking one guy right near the line though. It's not the Olympics, after all.</p>

<p>So that was that, I finished, had a great experience and finished with enough left in the tank that doing the Olympic distance race in London didn't seem impossible. Because of the timing chip mishap I didn't get accurate split times for the transitions and the bike, but my total time in the end was 1:42:37, which is not great but not that bad either for a first try. All in all I can't recommend this triathlon highly enough, my mother couldn't say enough about how well organised it was and also how well exiting the car park compared to a Robbie Williams concert.</p>
