Back in September I spent a <a href="http://www.planetmarshall.co.uk/2011/10/vancouver/" target="_blank">week in Vancouver</a> with clients, and during that time I had an opportunity to get out into the local mountains. Earlier this year I once again had the opportunity to visit Canada's wettest city, but this time for a three month period from April-June, and I was determined to make the most of it.

The company keeps an apartment ( or did until recently, I was the final occupant ) in a building known as 'Seawalk North'. I'm told it's quite small by Canadian standards, which is probably true if apartments are sized in proportion to their cars and breakfasts. It was, to me at least, a palace in a spectacular setting overlooking the harbour on False Creek, Burrard Bridge and Granville Island. The location is a magnet for the joggers, cyclists and rollerbladers  who traverse parts of the seawalk that runs from Stanley Park in the north to Kitsilano in the south. The only downside was the vast glass wall at one end of the open plan living area that provides the aforementioned views, as it has the side effect of magnifying the temperature in the apartment - though it could be argued that this is a small price to pay.
<h2>Trail Running</h2>
Missing the level of fitness I had attained since I ran the Berlin Marathon, in 2012 I had set myself the aim of running one race a month, and my temporary relocation had complicated this somewhat. April was to prove fairly straightforward, however, in that one of the largest 10k runs in the world is run every year in Vancouver at around that time, the Vancouver Sun Run.

The Sun Run, enjoyable as it is, is a road run, and not really what interests me these days. Hill running as we know it in Scotland, Fell running in England and Wales, does not really exist in Canada as their peaks are well above Munro height (3000 ft), the highest if not glaciated at least holding snow well into the summer months, and the lower slopes being heavily forested as the UK would have been thousands of years ago ( It would be difficult, though perhaps not impossible, to provide something like the Bob Graham round in Vancouver - I suggested such a thing to a peak bagger while there and shall be interested to see if the idea gains traction ). Trail running, however, is gaining popularity
<h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
The last word in climbing in the Vancouver area is Squamish, it's probably the first word as well though there are other locations. The Stawamus Chief that  is a huge granite monolith located on the outskirts of Squamish just off Highway 99, also known as The Sea to Sky Highway and possessed of some of the most spectacular road side scenery you're likely to see, though in my biased opinion I'd say that the A9 through Glencoe probably just about edges it out in this respect. 'The Chief' sports both bolted and traditionally protected routes ( by far the more common variety here in the UK ) that attract attention from climbers from all over the world. My first multi-pitch route on the Chief, and in fact my first multi-pitch route anywhere, was to be an 8 pitch variation of 'Diedre', widely regarded as one of the best routes of its grade ( YDS 5.8 ) anywhere in the world. During my stay I would also climb 'Seasoned in the Sun' (YDS 5.10a) and 'Calculus Crack' (YDS 5.8) as well as some pleasant but forgettable climbs in the Smoke Bluffs. All in all I had by now climbed far more in Canada than I had in my native Scotland, and was feeling inspired to get out a lot more as soon as I returned to the UK.
<h2>Alpine Mountaineering</h2>
I had not arrived at the best time for Alpine Mountaineering in BC's coastal ranges. The best weather for such activities are sustained periods of high pressure, which when they occur at all in that area of the world, are most likely to be experienced July-September. Those accustomed to weather conditions on the west coast of Scotland would feel right at home in south west British Columbia.

It was not long after I had arrived in Canada that I joined the British Columbia Mountaineering Club, a large club and a touch more formal than my local Jacobites MC but nonetheless friendly and well organized with a number of trips planned over the three months that I would be staying. My first attempt would be a short day climbing the North Ramp of Mt Harvey, which lies on the Howe Sound Crest Trail, the location of my brief adventure the previous Autumn.
