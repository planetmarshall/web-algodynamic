<a href="http://www.planetmarshall.co.uk/music/Rach_Op3_2.mp3">Prelude in C&#x266f; Minor by Sergei Rachmaninoff.</a>
<p class="pm_first"><span>I</span>n December I had my first piano recital in nearly two years, and so I started to look into various methods that performers use to conquer performance anxiety, something which causes me a lot of grief. Lately I've been hanging around with a number of friends involved in Cambridge's thriving local music scene, and so not willing to go the beta blockers route I started thinking about doing some recordings. This way not only do I get to hear what the audience hears but it also reproduces some of the pressure that comes with performing for an audience. The audiofile above is my first effort, a recording of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C&#x266f; Minor.</p>

<p>Ok, nobody's ever going to sign me up for any recording contracts and there were a number of dodgy chords in that last section but I thought it was pretty good for a first effort. It was recorded in one take and I haven't added anything else since the whole point of this exercise is as practice for a live performance.</p>
<h3>Kit</h3>
<p>[singlepic=27,150,100,left] I spent a little under Â£200 ( excluding the piano and the laptop ) on the recording kit, from <a href="http://www.dv247.com/" target="_new">Digital Village</a> in Cambridge. I used an <a target="_new" href="http://www.alesis.com/io2">Alesis IO|2</a> stereo mixer attached to a laptop running a cutdown version of <a href="http://www.steinberg.net/en/products/musicproduction/cubaseessential4_product.html" target="_new">Cubase</a> that came with the mixer, and a couple of cheap microphones stuffed down the piano cabinet and secured with parcel tape. The piano is a fairly largish Kawai upright.</p>
