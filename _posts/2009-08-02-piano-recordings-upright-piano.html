<p class="pm_first">This is the second in a series of attempts to do some piano recordings, a project which started out of a desire to conquer stagefright on the rare occasions that I perform in public. Increasingly I have been investigating the process in more depth, making use of Cubase and various recording techniques. The result of these investigations is this recording of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in D Major, which I performed at a recital in June. This represents probably the best recording I can achieve given my upright piano and limited knowledge of recording techniques.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>
[singlepic=74,150,right] This <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan08/articles/pianorecording_0108.htm" target="_new">article</a> from Sound on Sound describes a number of piano recording methods, including several for upright piano. The simple fact is that an upright piano is not a suitable instrument for recording, however by following some of the advice in the article I think i have probably got the best I can from the instrument and the equipment available. The picture on the right shows the setup, which is as follows
<ul>
	<li>Kawai upright piano</li>
	<li>Alesis IO|2 stereo interface</li>
	<li>Pair AKG Perceptron 150 microphones in crossed stereo configuration</li>
	<li>Laptop computer running Cubase LE ( supplied with the Alesis hardware )</li>
</ul>
Most of the kit is quite portable, so at some point I hope to repeat the experiment with a grand piano and compare the results.
