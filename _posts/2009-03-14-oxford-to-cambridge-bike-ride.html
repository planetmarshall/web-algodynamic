[singlepic=46,150,left]<p class="pm_first"><span>O</span>n 27th September 2008 I and three friends took part in the Hearts First Bike Ride from Oxford to Cambridge in aid of the <a target="_new" href="http://www.bhf.org.uk/get_involved/take_part_in_our_events/bike_rides.aspx">British Heart Foundation</a>. 

My friends stayed in Oxford overnight and probably started the day with a hearty breakfast. Unfortunately I had to make the start in Cambridge resulting in a 6.00am coach ride from Cambridge, a coach ride I almost missed due to a faulty alarm clock. One coffee cup and a muffin is no way to start a 90 mile bike ride ( or 86.78 according to my GPS ). I completed the ride in just shy of 5 hours, which admittedly is not that great but I use the excuse that it wasn't a race and I had no one to draft.

Anyone who knows the route and takes a closer look at the map below may be wondering why I took a wrong turn in the centre of Cambridge resulting in me having to go down King St instead of the more sensible Emmanuel Rd route. This was basically because I wasn't paying attention and I still had the London to Cambridge ride in the back of my mind, which took the former route.
