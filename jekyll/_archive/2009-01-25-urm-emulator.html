<p class="pm_first"><span>T</span>he Unlimited Register Machine (URM), designed by <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521294652" target="_new">Nigel Cutland</a>, is an abstraction of a computer similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" target="_new">Turing Machine</a> - but somewhat easier to get to grips with and more in tune with the operation of a modern computer processor.</p>
It also happens to be the model used by the Open University's course on <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01M381" target="_new">Mathematical Logic and Number Theory</a>, and is the reason for this article since I studied the course in 2007.

<h3>Emulator</h3>
The implementation details of the emulator are quite interesting, using a mixture of Microsoft technologies including F# and Silverlight, however I will save that for another article for those interested in such things. To use the Emulator just hit Reset, enter the program and initial registers and click Step to trace through the program.
