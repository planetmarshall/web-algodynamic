There are no shortage of implementations of SVMs on the web, for example LibSVM and SVMLight. However, these libraries are written in C and I wanted to take a more modern approach using the new features of C++11 and a Boost-style header-only library.

A straightforward sequential implementation, and parallel implementations in both OpenMP/SIMD and CUDA are discussed
