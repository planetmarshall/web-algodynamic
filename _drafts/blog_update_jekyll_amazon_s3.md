title: "Blog Update : Static Web Hosting with Jekyll and Amazon S3"
---
It'd been a while since the last time I posted so I decided that a new post should come with a bit of a facelift for the blog. Actually, it's a good bit more than just a facelift - since most of the work has been in moving from a dynamic self-hosted blogging engine like Wordpress to an entirely statically generated site hosted on Amazon S3. The upshot of this is that it costs me nothing in fees to have the blog hosted by Amazon, as I fall into their free usage tier. It comes at the expense of some of the ease of use of Wordpress, but being a developer I don't mind that so much as it gives me the excuse to play with some new tech.

Jekyll
------

A statically generated site means that the entire blog exists in the form of multiple HTML pages, images, CSS and Javascript. However, that doesn't mean that I have to create all of this content manually - that would indeed be tedious. Jekyll is a static web site creation tool that allows me to retain some of the ease of use of Wordpress
