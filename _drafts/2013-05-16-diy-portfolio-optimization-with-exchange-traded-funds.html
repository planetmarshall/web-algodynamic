<blockquote>It should, hopefully, go without saying that if you decide to try any of these methods with your own money then the risks, and the rewards, are entirely your own.</blockquote>
I'm a big fan of Coursera's online courses, and at the beginning of this year I took Washington University's course in Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics. This coincided with me recently reading John Kay's "The long and the short of it" and so I wanted to try my hand at investing and put my money where my mouth was.

I've decided to start simple, with two risky assets. If all goes well I may follow up this post with some more advanced techniques.
<h2>Choosing my assets</h2>
I setup an account with Barclays Stockbrokers and opened an Investment ISA, which allows me to invest up to Â£11k tax free from a wide choice of stocks and funds. Since it's my own money at risk here I've chosen to use Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) as my risky assets, rather than stocks, as they are already well diversified but unlike managed funds incur no management fee.

Even so, there are a variety of ETFs to choose from. I have opted for iShares FTSE 100 and BRIC, for no particular reason. A more systematic approach migh look for the funds with the best Sharpe Ratio, but this would require writing code to scrape Barclays' website for that information, and that is not the focus of this post. The goal will simply be to achieve an equal or better rate of return than investing in only one of these assets could achieve, but at a lower risk.
<h2>Getting the data</h2>
