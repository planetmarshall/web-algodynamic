In November 2012, Chris Taylor correctly predicted 50/51 of the electoral college votes in the US election, using a far simpler model than the one that has been much publicized by Nate Silver in the Washington Post. I had enough confidence in Chris' model to put my money where his mouth was and bought some shares on InTrade's prediction market, and making a small profit.

This led me to wonder just what other popularity contests might lend themselves to a mathematical analysis. Enter the BBC's <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>, 2012.
