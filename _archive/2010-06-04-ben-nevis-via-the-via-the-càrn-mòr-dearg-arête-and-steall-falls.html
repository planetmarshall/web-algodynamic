<p class="pm_first">Following our adventures in the Lake District in January, I and a group of friends travelled to Fort William at the end of May for four days of camping in the wild with the aim of climbing Ben Nevis, this time ably assisted by someone who actually knew what they were doing - soon to be Wordsworth Trust Poet in Residence Helen Mort. Originally we had also planned to tackle the classic Ring of Steall route, but this proved to be too much for one trip, and Nevis was quite spectacular enough.</p>
There are two major routes for walkers tackling Ben Nevis, the classic Pony Track ( somewhat dismissingly known as the 'tourist route' ) and a more demanding ridge walk along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ( CMD Arête for short ). Few reports on the web do this latter route justice, and none from the perspective of a fairly inexperienced walker who prior to January last did this kind of stuff as part of DofE expeditions about 15 years ago. I am also fairly sure that none of said reports consider what it's like to do the route carrying a fully loaded 65L rucksack with enough gear to be self sufficient for 4 days.
