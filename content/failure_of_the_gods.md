Title: The Failure of the Gods.

The Scottish Winter season is in full swing, and I'm currently sitting in the Kinlochewe hotel bar browsing Instagram.
The filtered successes of the Scottish Winter Climbing community. Mountains. Snow. Icefalls. Axes and Glory. I want to be among them. Having just finished
two pints of Red Dragon, I spot a bottle of Octomore on a high shelf; one of several well stocked with Scottish
Whiskies. It's unusual enough to merit mentioning to the landlord, who declares the heavily peated single malt to be his favourite. It's mine too,
and so I ask for a single. I'm going to need it.

Susan is soon out of sight of the belay, but the steady feed of the rope through the belay device indicates good
progress. Better than good. 

The pitch is hard. Much harder than I was expecting, and I'm in awe of Susan. Every metre of upward progress is hard
won, and with every metre my trepidation increases. I climb without incident, but I know I'm at the limit of my ability,
making moves I can only do with the confidence of the top rope.  I don't know if I could have led this pitch, and I
start to doubt if I can lead the second, before I've even seen it.

Noise from below indicates Calum has started to lead behind me. It's a little too soon for my liking, and his proximity
is pressure I could do without. It's his decision though. In Winter the daylight hours are short, and I can't blame him
for not wanting to risk a climb in darkness.

With the vernacular of the enthusiastic climbing youth, Calum looks up at the next pitch and declares himself to be
'psyched'. I am not psyched. I am fucking petrified.

I try to remember the guidebook description. 

As soon as my feet are back on the ground I feel a convulsion of relief. It feels like the right decision, and Susan agrees - 
but almost immediately I know that I will be second guessing myself for days, my thoughts saturated with 'what ifs'. What if I had pushed on, making the harder choice, 
not conquering but embracing my fear of the unknown, of uncertainty. Would I have been shortly celebrating
leading what a friend has described as one of the best pitches in Scotland? Or would I have woken up in A&E, or worse, not woken up at all.

Faced with some hard choices to make closer to home I often think back to that decision and yearn for the simplicity of a binary outcome. 
Success or failure. Life or death. But what if, no matter whether I take the
difficult or easy path, there may be no good outcome for me. The only measure of success is in the paths that other
lives take,

I'm not what you could call a spiritual person. My world is the world of mathematics and logic, where even chaos
 and uncertainty follow the laws of nature. I believe in physics, not karma. While
we are all the centre of our own pocket universe, the actual universe carries on regardless and is under no obligation to
be fair to anyone. The sum of all human experience a flicker among the lifetime of stars.



I point the car South, and look at the mountains of the North West in the rear view mirror, knowing I'll be back here again.
