title: The Failure of the Gods.
date: 2018-02-28

The Scottish Winter season is in full swing, and I'm currently sitting in the Kinlochewe hotel bar browsing Instagram.
The filtered successes of the Scottish Winter Climbing community. Mountains. Snow. Icefalls. Axes and Glory. I want to be among them. Having just finished
two pints of Red Dragon, I spot a bottle of Octomore on a high shelf; one of several well stocked with Scottish
Whiskies. It's unusual enough to merit mentioning to the landlord, who declares the heavily peated single malt to be his favourite. It's mine too,
and so I ask for a single. I'm going to need it.

Susan is soon out of sight of the belay, but the steady feed of the rope through the belay device indicates good
progress. Better than good. 

The pitch is hard. Much harder than I was expecting, and I'm in awe of Susan. Every metre of upward progress is hard
won, and with every metre my trepidation increases. I climb without incident, but I know I'm at the limit of my ability,
making moves I can only do with the confidence of the top rope.  I don't know if I could have led this pitch, and I
start to doubt if I can lead the second, before I've even seen it.

Noise from below indicates Calum has started to lead behind me. It's a little too soon for my liking, and his proximity
is pressure I could do without. It's his decision though, I have no control over the climbers below.

With the vernacular of the enthusiastic climbing youth, Calum looks up at the next pitch and declares himself to be
'psyched'. I am not psyched. I am fucking petrified.

I try to remember the guidebook description.
